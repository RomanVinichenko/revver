                    <p>The athletic brand has been growing fast, thanks to a pandemic-fueled leisurewear market and new
                        athlete ambassadors. And while other companies move carefully when it comes to returning to the
                        office and lean heavily on small satellite offices across the nation, PUMA opened a new
                        150,000-square-foot headquarters in Somerville, Massachusetts, consolidating its two former
                        offices in nearby Boston and the nearby suburb of Westford.
                    </p>
                    <p>The intention? Speed recruiting and propel creativity and innovation.</p>
                    <p>Out of Office talked to Philion to find out more about PUMA’s aggressive bet on the office while
                        many executives are treading cautiously.

                    <p>The first step to creating an inclusive work culture is learning your colleagues’ names. People
                        respond more positively when they feel acknowledged and respected. It is proven time and time
                        again that people are a lot more receptive in discussions when they are recognized. This is your
                        responsibility as a peer, colleague, and — especially — as a manager.</p>

                            people decide to circumvent my name entirely to prevent making a mistake. The worst part is
                            that they say everyone’s name except mine. Your intention is not to get my name wrong, but
                            the impact makes me feel.

                            heard this name before or how difficult it will be to get it right. This makes me feel
                            “othered,” and that because my name is different, I too am different and thus don’t belong.

                            I will be able to get this one right.” Some things do not need to be said publicly. You’re
                            doing so in a group setting makes me feel alienated.
                        </li>

                            <b>Continuously misspelling someone’s name in email exchanges.</b> Simply put — pay
                            attention. Before sending any email, whether the person is a senior executive, a manager, or
                            an intern, take the 10 seconds to make sure the spelling is correct. When you don’t, it
                            makes me feel dismissed.

                            <b>Pay attention</b> to how the individual pronounces their name. If it puzzles you, write
                            down the phonetic pronunciation in your notes. If you mispronounce it, own up to it and do
                            better.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Follow up.</b> If you forget how it is pronounced, say: “I am sorry, could you please
                            pronounce your name for me again. I want to make sure I get it right.” Apologies and
                            questions are always welcomed, but lack of effort or empathy are not.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Be an ally.</b> An old colleague and dear friend of mine would step in every time someone
                            would ignore me in meetings. Her strategy was so tactful: “This question is within Hadeil’s
                            expertise,” or “I will let Hadeil step in here to share her thoughts.” She made a point to
                            emphasize the correct pronunciation of my name.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Be self-aware.</b> There is a time and place for everything. Limit any repetitive
                            questions or comments about a colleague’s name in group settings.

                        <li>
                            <b>Make an effort.</b> It always goes back to doing the work. Regularly making mistakes
                            demonstrates a lack of effort and care. It communicates an unwillingness to prioritize your
                            colleagues and an inclusive work environment. It says a lot to me when some of my colleagues
                            get it right after one or two times, while others continuously make pronunciation mistakes
                            or completely ignore me in meetings. You are the problem, not my name.
