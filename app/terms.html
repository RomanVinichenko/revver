                <h4>Here is what you should avoid or ask your colleagues to avoid:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Avoiding the person’s name in a meeting/call.</b> I have been in countless meetings where
                        people decide to circumvent my name entirely to prevent making a mistake. The worst part is that
                        they say everyone’s name except mine. Your intention is not to get my name wrong, but the impact
                        makes me feel.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Making a point that my name is different.</b> You don’t need to state that you haven’t heard
                        this name before or how difficult it will be to get it right. This makes me feel “othered,” and
                        that because my name is different, I too am different and thus don’t belong.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Publicly stating your opinion on my name in a group.</b> “Interesting name. I am not sure I
                        will be able to get this one right.” Some things do not need to be said publicly. You’re doing
                        so in a group setting makes me feel alienated.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Continuously misspelling someone’s name in email exchanges.</b> Simply put — pay attention.
                        Before sending any email, whether the person is a senior executive, a manager, or an intern,
                        take the 10 seconds to make sure the spelling is correct. When you don’t, it makes me feel
                        dismissed.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h4>How to be part of the solution:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Pay attention</b> to how the individual pronounces their name. If it puzzles you, write down
                        the phonetic pronunciation in your notes. If you mispronounce it, own up to it and do better.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Follow up.</b> If you forget how it is pronounced, say: “I am sorry, could you please
                        pronounce your name for me again. I want to make sure I get it right.” Apologies and questions
                        are always welcomed, but lack of effort or empathy are not.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Be an ally.</b> An old colleague and dear friend of mine would step in every time someone
                        would ignore me in meetings. Her strategy was so tactful: “This question is within Hadeil’s
                        expertise,” or “I will let Hadeil step in here to share her thoughts.” She made a point to
                        emphasize the correct pronunciation of my name.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Be self-aware.</b> There is a time and place for everything. Limit any repetitive questions
                        or comments about a colleague’s name in group settings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Make an effort.</b> It always goes back to doing the work. Regularly making mistakes
                        demonstrates a lack of effort and care. It communicates an unwillingness to prioritize your
                        colleagues and an inclusive work environment. It says a lot to me when some of my colleagues get
                        it right after one or two times, while others continuously make pronunciation mistakes or
                        completely ignore me in meetings. You are the problem, not my name.
                    </li>
                </ol>
